## React + Vite + useElven

A demo where you can sign in using MultiversX signing providers and you can send a transaction to predefined address

All is based on `useElven` React tools.

This is basically a starting point when you would want to use React + Vite. Check the vite.config.cjs file. There is an important configuration to make it work.

There will be more examples and documentations.

### Development

You can use all tools from `@useelven/core`. Check the documentation.
All is based on Vite so check theirs docs.

The .env file here is commited in the repository for simplicity. Anyway, these are public variables.
